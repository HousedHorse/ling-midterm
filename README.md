# Components of Language

## Lexicon

- things about language that must be memorized
- vocabulary
- idioms (kick the bucket, etc.)

## Phonology

- sounds combined into larger words

## Syntax

- words combined into larger units

## Semantics

- relate meaning of expressions to meaning of parts



# Design Features of Human Language

## Discreteness

- discrete units

## Productivity

- discrete infinity
- parts of messages can be used to create parts of new messages

## Recursion

- categories can contain themselves

## Duality of Patterning

- two layers of structure
- sounds -> words
- words -> sentences

## Arbitrariness of the Sign

- connection between sound and meaning is unpredictable
- exceptions
  - onomatopoeia
  - sound symbolism (kiki, buba)

## Displacement

- communicate about things not immediately present

## Reflexiveness

- use language to talk about language

## Cultural Learning

- acquisition from community






# Onomatopoeia

- words formed by association to a sound
  - woof
  - quack




# Sound Symbolism

- kiki and buba
- bang, fizz, slide, slippery




# Language Learning and Language Diversity Relationship






# Signed Languages

- not different from other language
  - hand gestures can count as phonemes
- same features as other human language
  - duality of patterning
  - arbitrariness of the sign
- ASL grammar distinct from English
  - verbal aspect
  - word order
  - classifiers




# Vocal Tract Anatomy

## Humans

- short tongue
- lower larynx
- easier to move tongue freely
- easier to choke

## Apes

- long tongue
- higher larynx





# Differences Between Humans and Animals

- in general
  - no true productivity
  - no discrete combinatorial system

## Bee Waggle Dance

- two continuous scales
  - duration
  - direction

## Ape Communication

- aggression
- submission

## Vervet Monkeys

- alarm calls specific to predators
- whole unit message
- no productivity
- only a lexicon

## Bird Song

- syrinx instead of larynx
  - vibrations in membrane of trachea
- learn song in stages
  1) subsong
  2) plastic song
  3) crystallized song
- made up of discrete units
  - A A B B A C
  - follow a few basic patterns





# Basic Results of Animal Learning Experiments

- rhesus monkeys and rats learn algebraic rules A B C A B C A B C
- tamarins, bengalese finches, pigeons and learn finite-state grammars
- humans and tamarins can learn regular grammars
- only humans can do context free

## Order of Complexity

1) Finite-State Grammars (algebraic patterns): rats, monkeys, tamarins, finches, pigeons
2) Regular Grammars: humans, tamarins
3) Context-Free Grammars: humans only

# Language Family

- descended from common ancestor speech community
- from a common proto-language
- English and German



# Cognates

- words that share common origin
- features shared due to common descent




# Proto-Languages

1) proto-indo-european
2) niger-congo
3) austronesian
4) trans-new-guinea
5) sino-tibetan
6) indo-european
7) afro-asiatic



# Comparative Method

- feature-by-feature comparison of two languages with common ancestor
- study language development



# Dialect Maps

- geographical distribution of language speakers
- isoglosses = marks the boundary between linguistic features





# The Canadian Shift

![](img/can-shift.png)

- Canadian shift moves "bet" low and "pat" back
- Nothern cities shift is the opposite, moves "bet" high and "pat" forward




# Connection Between Change and Variation

- change leads to variation
  - grammar 1 affects language 1
  - language 1 affects grammar 2
- over time we are changing our grammar
- divergence across areas where language is spoken



# Variations and Social Meaning

- Labov fourth floor department store study
  - variation between different social classes
  - upper class keeps r, middle class uses some r, lower class uses almost no r
  - upper and lower classes don't change much after the get older
  - middle class changes to imitate upper class as they get older (middle class crossover)





# Basic Features of AAVE

## Habitual Tense

- the "habitual be"
  - "be" doesn't carry the same meaning as standard english
- She be runnin'
  - She is often running

## Negative Concord

- also used in Italian
- double negative indicates a single negative
- "I ain't never gonna love you"

## Copula Absence

- absence of "is" "are" "am" "were" etc.
- She runnin'
  - She is running




# Register

- formal, informal
- phonological reduction is usually informal register
- flapping "tt" -> "dd"
- unstressed vowel deletion
- contractions


# The Nature of Perspective Rules

- one of the variants is prescribed
  - this is the "right" way to do it




# Gender Differences in Language Use

- women use more conservative variants of stable sociolinguistic variables
- girls use non-standard variables with peers
- boys use non-standard variables with interviewers



# Gender as a Factor in Linguistic Change

- women conform more to overtly prescribed variants
  - conform less to variants that are not overtly prescribed
- women are one generation ahead of men



------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Basic Vocal Tract Anatomy

![](img/vocal-anatomy.png)






# Basic Ideas About Vowel Articulation and Acoustics

- front
- back
- high
- low
- resonance, acoustic performance
- tongue changes the shape of the vocal cavity
  - divides it in two





# Phoneme

- units of phonetics
- discrete units of sound



# Allophone

- the sounds that represent a single phoneme



# Minimal Pair

- pair words that differ by one sound




------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Presupposition

- implicit assumption related to an utterance
- Jim no longer walks on the beach
  - the presupposition is that he used to walk on the beach




# Implicature

- something a speaker implies with an utterance without expressing
  - "The picture frame is nice"
  - the implication is I don't like the picture *inside the frame*




# Grice's Maxims

- speakers are good
- act in good faith during a conversation
- speakers are cooperative
- assume other speakers are cooperative
- quality, quantity, reverence


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Syntactic Bootstrapping

- duality of patterning -> syntax
- children are born with the innate ability to understand syntax



# Phonological Bootstrapping

- duality of patterning -> phonology
- children are born with the innate ability to understand phonology


# Word Segmentation

- probability of when two sounds are next to each other
- children can segment words easily
- recognize own name by 4.5 months



# Parental Feedback

- children don't need it to learn their native language
- Simon learned to speak ASL better than his parents
- Trackton, parents don't talk to their children before they can speak



# Assumptions (Constraints) Guiding Learning of Word Meaning

- whole object assumption
  - words refer to whole objects
- taxonomic assumption
  - words refer to things of the same kind
- mutual exclusivity
  - words have a 1 to 1 mapping with meaning
  - only for monolinguals





------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Pidgin and Creole Characteristics

- pidgins
  - limited communication systems after contact
  - nobody's first language
  - small lexicon
  - unstructured, unsystematic
  - simple phonology, morphology

- creoles
  - full-fledged languages that develop from pidgins
  - native speakers
  - share some features with pidgins (simplicity of phonology and morphology)





# Difference Between Pidgins and Creoles

- native speakers
  - pidgin no, creole yes
- pidgin has smaller lexicon
- creole is more structured and systematic




# Superstrate/Lexifier vs Substrate

- socio-politically powerful language is superstrate or lexifier
- less powerful language is substrate
- English is the superstrate in Jamaican creole
- French is the superstrate in Hawaiian creole




# Language Bioprogram Hypothesis

- children faced with unstructured pidgins impose structure upon them
- universal human grammar
- this could be how pidgins become creoles




# Critical Period Hypothesis

- period in childhood when language acquisition is much easier
- adults start well, plateau quickly
- children start slowly and progress further
- could explain why pidgins never develop complexity, while creoles do




# Nicaraguan Sign Language

- creole sign language
- spontaneously emerging sign language in a new community
- children restructure input radically
  - give bias to certain grammatical structures and regularities
